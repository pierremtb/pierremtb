### Hi there üëã

I am currently a Junior Hardware Engineer at [Algolux](https://algolux.com), a Montreal-based company focused on robust perception in all conditions for autonomous vehicles or ADAS systems.
With degrees in Mechanical Engineering from France (my home country) and Canada plus a huge interest for software and cool tech, I'm working hard to reach a point of cross-functional understanding of products, with the ultimate goal of launching some.
Computationally curious, and it‚Äôs not up for debate.

Please drop me a line: meet at pierre dot coffee
