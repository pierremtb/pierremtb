### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! It's a place of experimentation which had a lot to do with my passion for programming and tech.

I am currently a Systems Engineer at @VehicleMind, a Montreal-based startup on a mission to disrupt the way we think about car maintenance.


With degrees in Mechanical Engineering from France (my home country) and Canada, I'm working hard to reach a point of cross-functional understanding of products, with the ultimate goal of launching some.

Computationally curious, and itâ€™s not up for debate.
